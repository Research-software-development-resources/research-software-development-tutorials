Research software development tutorials
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This documentation provides tutorials for understanding the key aspects of software development for researchers. Tutorials are provided for different levels of experience.

Why are these tutorials needed?
-------------------------------
There are many tutorials available on the web for understanding software development, however, they typically only consider specific aspects of software development. More general tutorials are often lengthy and cover more detail than required for student developers who are under time constraints (e.g. Masters and PhD students). Our philosophy is to provide curated links to existing documentation (emphasising reuse), with gaps filled in as required.
